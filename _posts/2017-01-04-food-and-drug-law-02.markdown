*These are my notes from the readings for class meeting 2 of Harvard Law School's Food and Drug Law course, led by Prof. Peter Barton Hutt on January 4, 2017. Reading for today's class meeting is pp. 163-289 and 1439-1485 of [Food and Drug Law 4th Ed.](http://a.co/2SDYPhS).*

### Interstate commerce

The Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution allows Congress to "regulate commerce... among the several States." In early U.S. history this was interpreted to mean that Congress has no authority over intra-state matters. Over the past 75 years, however, the Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to regulate products that are not only intra-state, but are produced and consumed within one household &mdash; originally wheat (Wickard v. Filburn 1942) and later marijuana (Gonzales v. Raich 2005). Therefore, per today's interpretation of the Constitution, Congress could ask FDA to regulate intra-state production and use of drugs.

But back in 1938, a more narrow interpretation prevailed, and so when Congress wrote the FD&C Act in that year it only granted FDA authority over interstate commerce. Through the various amendments to FD&C, Congress has loosened this restraint on FDA's power, but not completely so. Since FDAMA in 1997, when FDA takes a regulatory action on a product, "the connection with interstate commerce required for jurisdiction in such an action shall be presumed to exist." This shifts the burden of proof from the regulator to the regulated, but does not dispense with the underlying requirement, so someone subject to a specific FDA action could still challenge that action in court by demonstrating that the FDA had intervened where no interstate commerce existed.

Here are a few of the more interesting decisions regarding interstate limits on FDA authority:

+ *United States v. 7 Barrels... Spray Dried Whole Egg* (1944) was a civil forfeiture case where it was determined that FDA cannot seize foods that the manufacturer is holding within the state and has not yet made a move to ship out of state.
+ *United States v. Sanders* (1952) determined that FDA can intervene if somoene produces and sells drugs within their home state to out-of-state customers.
+ *United States v. Phelps Dodge Mercantile Co.* (1946) ruled that FDA cannot take action against adulterated food if the adulteration occurred after interstate shipment was complete, but Congress didn't like this and so in 1948 amended FD&C to also cover goods "while held forsale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment in interstate commerce."
+ [*United States v. Geborde*](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1019451.html) (2002) concerned a DJ who gave away gamma hydroxy-butyrate (GHB) for free to groupies within California. One person died as a result. (GHB is now an illegal drug but was not so in 1995-1996 when the crime occurred). The 9th Circuit Court determined that FDA doesn't have jurisdiction over things given away for free (no commerce).
+ *Baker v. United States* (1991) concerned a man who made and sold "synthetic heroin" within California but using reagents purchased from out-of-state. The court ruled that this was enough of a link to interstate commerce to justify FDA authority.

### Foreign commerce

FD&C as currently amended gives FDA authority to stop the import or export of drugs either if those drugs are misbranded, unsanitary, out of compliance, etc., or if the drugs are illegal or restricted in the foreign country they are either going to or coming from (even if legal in the United States).

*Cook v. FDA* (2013) concerned importation of thiopental, a drug used in lethal injection executions. States had imported it from a U.K. manufacturer that was not registered with the FDA, and FDA acknowledged it had jurisdiction but declined to enforce, out of deference to law enforcement. A group of death row inmates sued and won in the D.C. District Court, which held that FD&C actively required FDA to regulate such a matter.

Beginning in the early 2000s, various individuals, companies, and state benefit plans attempted to import prescription drugs from Canada, where drugs are cheaper than in the U.S. FDA issued a warning letter to RxDepot explaining that this was illegal because FDA does not just approve *a drug*, it approves a drug as manufactured by a specific manufacturer, and the Canadian producers of drugs had not been FDA approved, even if the drugs they were producing were known molecules for which other, U.S.-based, manufacturers had previously received FDA approval. RxDepot refused to stop, FDA pursued the case, and the courts sided with FDA. The State of Vermont also tried to buy Canadian drugs for its medical benefit plan, and again, courts sided with FDA. In the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Congress allowed that FDA could issue regulations or make case-by-case exceptions to its rules in order to allow Canadian imports, but only if the Secretary of HHS could "certify" to Congress that this will both offer cost savings and "pose no additional risk". No Secretary since has ever stepped up to make such a claim, and therefore this part of the 2003 Act remains unimplemented. There is, however, a longstanding exemption for individuals to import personal-use quantities of drugs in luggage or by mail. 

### Enforcement

Only the United States (and in certain specific cases, individual states) may take to the courts to enforce the FD&C, private citizens cannot do so. The procedure is that the FDA's Chief Counsel's office comes up with what actions it wants to take, and refers them to the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Division, Office of Consumer Product Litigation.

The 1906 Food and Drugs Act set forth seizure and criminal prosecution as enforcement mechanisms, the 1938 FD&C added injunction (court orders to stop a particular activity), inspection, and warning letters, and later amendments added civil suits, product recalls, administrative detention (FDA asking states to prevent a product from being moved before it can be seized), and debarment (banning an individual from submitting applications to FDA in the future). FDA uses all of these mechanisms to varying degrees. In practice, warning letters are often enough, perhaps because 1) these letters are public and generate negative publicity for the company being warned, and 2) companies are eager to comply with FDA and stay in good favor.

FDA generally prefers to regulate by issuing rules rather than by prosecuting individual offenses on a case-by-case basis to create precedents. Prof. Hutt (when he was Chief Counsel) argued that rules provide regulatory certainty, are quick, and are decisive. By contrast, case law takes years to develop, during which time the regulatory environment is uncertain, and at the end of all that, sometimes the court's decision doesn't actually address all of the different variables in play.

In general, regulatory agencies are allowed to go after just one or a few of many bad actors all committing the same violation, unless the choice of individual actors to prosecute is discriminatory (based on race, religion, or something like that) in which case the defendant could employ the "Selective Prosecution" defense. However, in FDA's case, however, in *United States v. Undetermined Quantities of an Article of Drug Labeled Exachol* (1989), the courts ruled that FDA could *not* go after just one bad actor. The defendant, Health Club, had apparently made unjustified health claims about a substance it was selling called Exachol, and the courts ruled that the Exachol situation was subtantially similar to that of fish oil pills or Kellogg's All-Bran, and that FDA had to go after either all or none.

A few interesting tidbits about some of these enforcement mechanisms:

+ **Criminal prosecution**. FDA can prosecute individuals, such as a company's president, for a company's violations of FD&C. The FD&C Act specifies that the individual in question does not need to have initiated the illegal action or to have been aware of it, as long as they have a "responsible relation" to it.
+ **Inspection**. FDA conducts both random inspections and "for cause" inspections. Because companies subject to FDA are considered to be regularly and routinely monitored ("closely regulated"), the courts have ruled that under the *Colonnade-Biswell* exception to the Fourth Amendment, FDA does *not* need a warrant to seize goods during an inspection.
+ **Recalls**. Usually FDA asks the manufacturer to initiate a recall, and they comply. Thus most recalls are voluntary recalls. But FDA can also do mandatory recalls.
+ **Debarment**. FDA has never debarred a corporation, only individuals. When FDA debars an individual, that individual may never again provide services to any company that submits an application to FDA.
