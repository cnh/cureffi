### Backgrounder

Cystic fibrosis is the classic example of a recessive disease. It is classic because it's shockingly common: the &Delta;F508 mutation alone has an allele frequency of [just over 1% in Europeans](http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/7-117199644-ATCT-A). This is a far higher allele frequency than natural selection would normally tolerate for any recessive disease mutation, especially one that, until modern medicine became good at managing symptoms, was lethal in early childhood [[Quinton 1999]]. It's therefore speculated that this mutation simply *must* confer some sort of heterozygote advantage, and a lot of possible explanations have been proposed, including resistance to cholera toxin [[Gabriel 1994]], reduced risk of asthma [[Schroeder 1995]] and resistance to *Salmonella typhi* [[Pier 1998]], though no answer has emerged as conclusive.

*CFTR* encodes a chloride channel, and different genetic mutations cause a loss of its function by different mechanisms. Nonsense and frameshift mutations simply abolish the full-length protein. Splice site variants can reduce expression levels. &Delta;F508 causes the protein to be retained and degraded in the ER instead of transported to the cell surface, possibly by burying the di-acidic signal for cell surface localization [[Wang 2004]]. R334W affects the ability of chloride to pass through the channel. Finally, a whole class of missense variants including G551D affect the "gating" of the chloride channel.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, with the help $75M in funding [contributed](http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/cystic-fibrosis-foundation-therapeutics-to-pay-vertex-75m-in-second-deal/81244966/) by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, developed the drug ivacaftor (Kalydeco&trade;) which corrects CFTR gating defects. It received [FDA approval in 2012](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm289633.htm) after clinical trials in compound heterozygous patients with G551D and a different mutation *in trans* [[Accurso 2010], [Ramsey 2011]]. It was exceptionally effective in one G551D homozygote [[Harrison 2013]]. In 2014, ivacaftor's indication was [expanded](http://investors.vrtx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=827435) to include eight other missense mutations associated with gating defects. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has since [sold its royalties on the drug](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/for-cystic-fibrosis-foundation-venture-yields-windfall-in-hope-and-cash.html) for $3.3 billion, and in his 2015 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama [praised](http://www.cff.org/aboutCFFoundation/NewsEvents/1-21-Obama-Highlights-CF-in-State-of-the-Union.cfm) ivacaftor as an example of what he hopes is a new wave of precision medicine drugs.

Without doubt, ivcaftor is a smashing success story. Yet even with its newly expanded indication, it is approved for only a few percent of CF patients. About 70% of CF patients have at least one &Delta;F508 allele [[Castellani 2008]]. These patients and Vertex Pharmaceuticals alike would be thrilled if ivacaftor were to prove effective for that mutation as well. The paper for this week [[van Goor 2014]] therefore sets out to quantify the degree to which ivacaftor corrects defects in cells expressiong *CFTR* with a panel of different genetic mutations.
