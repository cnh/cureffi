*These are my notes from week 10 of Harvard's [Genetics 228: Genetics in Medicine from Bench to Bedside](http://www2.massgeneral.org/bbs/gen228/gen228_syllabus_material.asp) course, held on April 10, 2015. Lectures by [Dr. A. John Iafrate](http://www.massgeneral.org/pathology/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1304) and [Dr. Alice Shaw](http://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/doctor.aspx?ID=17279).*

### Reading

The paper for this week is *Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer* [[Kwak 2010]], which reports positive results from an early phase clinical trial of crizotinib for tumors with *ALK* translocations. Crizotinib later [received FDA approval in 2013](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-crizotinib). The drug is often rightly held up as an example of genomic precision medicine - a drug targeted to a specific driver mutation in cancer. I have previously blogged about crizotinib's success in [this post](/2014/11/24/we-can-and-should-do-clinical-trials-in-rare-diseases/).
